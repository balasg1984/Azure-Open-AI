With our mission to be the best browser for business, we are harnessing the power of AI to help you and your organization to stay on the cutting edge. Microsoft Edge continues to be your copilot for the web—the first to integrate AI-powered search, and the only one with Bing built-in. And our vision is to empower organizations with enterprise-compliant AI – with a commitment to delivering new capabilities in ways that meet our existing commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise. Over the last few months, you may have seen Microsoft announced AI-powered innovations, such as the new Bing with its chat and compose capabilities, Bing Image Creator, and most recently, Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is designed for business use. Today, we’re excited to announce that Microsoft 365 Copilot, currently in private preview, will be natively integrated into Microsoft Edge.

Microsoft 365 Copilot offers new capabilities that combine the power of large language models, Microsoft 365 apps, and your data in the Microsoft Graph—such as your calendar, emails, chats, documents, and more—to do things you’ve never been able to do before. For example: You can type natural language requests like “Tell my team how we updated the product strategy today,” and Microsoft 365 Copilot will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads. In combination with Edge, Microsoft 365 Copilot becomes even more intuitive by following the context of what you’re looking at in the browser to provide better answers.
